# TODO using React, Golang and Fiber!

This is part of my side projects. Creating a new Todo system using React, golang and fiber. 

# Next steps: 
 - Soon
 - ...


# How execute:

## First, create a .env file and define the follow environment variables: 
- API_PORT=
- DB_USER=
- DB_PASS=
- DB_NAME=
- DB_PORT=
- DB_HOST=

Notice that in this repository I''m using **MySQL** database.

## Second, open two terminals tabs.
- Choose one to run the frontend. Open the directory `frontend` and run: `yarn dev` to start the react server
- Then, open the folder `server` and run: `go run main.go` to start Fiber Server
- Now check the localhost port running the react, and enjoy it!
